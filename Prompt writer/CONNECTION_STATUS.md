# Prompt Writer - Webhook Connection Status

## Current Status: üîå Connected with Fallback

The Prompt Writer application has been successfully connected to the n8n webhook URL:
```
https://n8n.srv970139.hstgr.cloud/webhook/0dcd9b71-bf7f-4519-86bd-20304f600c4c
```

### What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **Webhook URL Updated**: The application is now using the correct webhook endpoint
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: When the webhook is not properly configured for POST requests, the application falls back to local optimization
3. **User Notifications**: Clear messages inform users when local optimization is being used
4. **Full Functionality**: All features remain functional regardless of webhook configuration

### Current Behavior üìù

When you click "Generate AI Prompt", the application:
1. Attempts to send a POST request to the n8n webhook
2. Detects that the webhook is configured for GET requests (not POST)
3. Automatically falls back to local optimization
4. Displays: "Prompt generated with local optimization! (Webhook not configured for POST requests)"

### To Enable Full AI Processing üîß

To use the n8n workflow for AI prompt optimization instead of local simulation:

1. **Configure the Webhook for POST Requests**:
   - Login to your n8n instance: https://n8n.srv970139.hstgr.cloud
   - Find the workflow with webhook ID: `0dcd9b71-bf7f-4519-86bd-20304f600c4c`
   - Edit the Webhook trigger node
   - Change HTTP Method from GET to POST
   - Ensure the workflow returns JSON in the expected format
   - Save and activate the workflow

2. **Expected Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "optimizedPrompt": "AI-optimized prompt text",
       "suggestions": ["Suggestion 1", "Suggestion 2"],
       "improvements": ["Improvement 1", "Improvement 2"]
     }
   }
   ```

### Testing the Connection üß™

After configuring the webhook for POST requests:
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3000/
2. Create a prompt or select a template
3. Click "Generate AI Prompt"
4. You should see "Prompt optimized with AI!" instead of the fallback message

### Files Modified üìÅ

1. `src/services/api.ts` - Updated webhook URL and added fallback handling
2. `src/components/PromptGenerator.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and user notifications
3. `src/index.css` - Fixed CSS import order
4. `README.md` - Updated documentation
5. Created documentation files:
   - `WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION.md` - Technical details of the integration
   - `n8n-webhook-setup.md` - Setup guide for configuring the webhook
   - `CONNECTION_STATUS.md` - This file

### Support üìö

For additional help:
- Review `n8n-webhook-setup.md` for detailed webhook configuration
- Check the browser console for debugging information
- The application will continue to work with local optimization until the webhook is properly configured
