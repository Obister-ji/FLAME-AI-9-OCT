# Webhook Issue: "Not configured for POST requests"

## What This Issue Means

When you see the message "Webhook not configured for POST requests", it means:

1. **Our application is trying to send data** to the n8n webhook using the HTTP POST method
2. **The n8n webhook is only configured to accept GET requests** (which are typically used for retrieving data, not sending it)
3. **The webhook returns a 404 error** when we try to send POST requests

## Why This Happens

Webhooks in n8n can be configured to accept different HTTP methods:
- **GET requests**: Used to retrieve information
- **POST requests**: Used to submit/send data to be processed

For a prompt writer application, we need to:
1. **Send** the user's prompt to n8n (requires POST)
2. **Receive** the optimized prompt back from n8n

## The Solution

You need to configure your n8n webhook to accept POST requests. Here's how:

### Step 1: Access Your n8n Workflow
1. Go to your n8n instance: https://n8n.srv970139.hstgr.cloud
2. Login to your account
3. Find the workflow that contains the webhook with ID: `0dcd9b71-bf7f-4519-86bd-20304f600c4c`

### Step 2: Configure the Webhook
1. Open the workflow for editing
2. Find the **Webhook trigger node** (usually the first node)
3. Click on the webhook node to open its settings
4. Look for **HTTP Method** or **Request Method** setting
5. Change it from **GET** to **POST**
6. Save the changes

### Step 3: Test the Webhook
1. Make sure the workflow is **activated** (turned on)
2. Try generating a prompt in the application again
3. You should now see "Prompt optimized with AI!" instead of the fallback message

## What the Application Does Currently

Until the webhook is configured for POST requests:
1. The app tries to send a POST request with the prompt data
2. n8n responds with a 404 error (not configured for POST)
3. The app detects this error and falls back to local simulation
4. You see the message explaining what happened

## Visual Guide

```
Current State:
[App] --POST request--> [n8n Webhook: GET only] --404 error--> [App]
                                                   |
                                                   v
                                              [Uses local simulation]

Desired State:
[App] --POST request--> [n8n Webhook: POST enabled] --Processes AI--> [App]
```

## Need Help?

If you're not sure how to configure the webhook:
1. Check the `n8n-webhook-setup.md` file for detailed steps
2. Look for n8n documentation on configuring webhook triggers
3. The n8n community forum has many examples of webhook configurations

**Bottom Line**: The webhook needs to be configured to accept POST requests instead of just GET requests for the AI prompt optimization to work through n8n.
