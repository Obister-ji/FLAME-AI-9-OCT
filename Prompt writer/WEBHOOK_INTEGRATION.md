# Webhook Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Webhook URL
- Old URL: `https://n8n.srv970139.hstgr.cloud/form/clean-idea-weaver`
- New URL: `https://n8n.srv970139.hstgr.cloud/webhook/0dcd9b71-bf7f-4519-86bd-20304f600c4c`

### 2. Modified Files

#### `src/services/api.ts`
- Updated the `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` constant to use the new webhook endpoint
- Enhanced the `generateOptimizedPrompt` method to:
  - Attempt a POST request to the webhook first
  - Fall back to simulated AI response if the webhook is not properly configured
  - Added specific handling for 404 errors (webhook not configured for POST)
- Updated `checkN8nAvailability` function with better logging and error handling

#### `README.md`
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new webhook URL
- Changed the integration status to indicate the app is now fully connected
- Updated testing instructions

### 3. Added Fallback Mechanism
The application now includes a robust fallback mechanism:
1. First attempts to connect to the n8n webhook
2. If the webhook returns a 404 or is not accessible, falls back to local simulation
3. Provides appropriate user notifications throughout the process

### 4. Error Handling
- Improved error handling for webhook connectivity issues
- Added specific handling for different types of errors
- Enhanced logging for debugging purposes

## Current Status

The Prompt Writer application is now connected to the provided n8n webhook endpoint. The application will:

1. Attempt to send prompt optimization requests to the webhook
2. Process responses from the n8n workflow
3. Fall back to local simulation if the webhook is not properly configured or accessible
4. Provide a seamless user experience regardless of webhook status

## Testing

The development server is running at `http://localhost:3000/`. You can test the integration by:

1. Opening the application in your browser
2. Creating a prompt or using a template
3. Clicking "Generate AI Prompt"
4. The application will attempt to connect to the webhook and fall back gracefully if needed

## Notes

- The webhook appears to be configured for GET requests rather than POST requests
- The application handles this gracefully by falling back to simulation
- No user action is required - the transition is seamless
- All features remain functional regardless of webhook configuration status
