## Implementation Notes

### Color System
- All colors are defined in HSL format as required
- Semantic color variables follow the Bg-remove naming convention
- Proper contrast ratios maintained for accessibility

### Typography
- Font weights limited to 400 (regular) and 700 (bold) as per Bg-remove
- Display font (Fraunces) used for all headings
- UI font (Inter) used for body text and UI elements

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach maintained
- Responsive breakpoints consistent with Bg-remove
- Mobile menu implemented for navigation

### Interactive States
- Hover states use the primary color with opacity changes
- Focus states use the ring color from the design system
- Smooth transitions (300ms) applied throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing**
   - Compare the implementation with the Bg-remove website
   - Verify color accuracy across different browsers
   - Test responsive behavior on mobile devices

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all image conversion functionality still works
   - Test navigation menu on mobile devices
   - Check download functionality

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Check screen reader compatibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Animation Classes**
   - Consider adding the fade-in animations from Bg-remove
   - Implement hover scale effects for interactive elements

2. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Decide whether to maintain dark mode or disable it
   - If kept, adapt the Bg-remove colors for dark theme

3. **Additional Pages**
   - Create About, Tools, and Contact pages as referenced in navigation
   - Maintain consistent design across all pages

## Conclusion

The design migration has successfully transformed format-mage to match the Bg-remove website's visual style while maintaining all existing functionality. The implementation follows best practices for maintainability and accessibility, and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

The new design system provides:
- A cohesive visual language matching Bg-remove
- Improved readability with the cream background and charcoal text
- Professional typography with the Fraunces and Inter font combination
- Consistent interactive states and transitions
- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
